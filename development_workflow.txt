DevStack based development -
- /opt/stack/<proj> - is the working directory
  - master is the stable working branch
  - topicbranch is the WIP branch
- /home/<proj> - is the checkin directory
  - master is the downloaded branch, not of much significance
  - dev-base is the branch at per by commit with /opt/stack/<proj>-(master)
  - topicbranch is the point of check-in

Workflow
- Develop at /opt/stack/<proj>(topicbranch), test, generate a patch
- Apply the patch at /home/<proj>(topicbranch), using suro_devs_git_reapply()
- Run 'tox -epy27', run 'tox -epep8'
- Try the modified patch at /opt/stack/<proj>(topicbranch), if required
- Initiate review from /home/<proj>(topicbranch)
